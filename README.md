# Launching The Project
Infinity Scheduler requires xampp for local development. You get xampp here: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html. Once xampp is installed, clone this repository into 
xampp/htdocs/. Then, make sure xampp is running and navigate to xampp/htdocs/Infinity-Scheduler/Infinity-Scheduler/ and run "npm run devbuild". This will create a build of
the vueJS frontend and copy the php server files into xampp/htdocs. The site should be running at localhost at this point. "npm run devbuild" will have to be run after
each update is made in order to see any changes made.
