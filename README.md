# About the Project / Scope
Infinity Scheduler is a web app that aims to function as a smart scheduler with many convenient features, such as factoring in travel times, cross referencing other calendars to plan group events, suggesting times for new events, automatically rescheduling events if they are missed, automatically detecting if an event has been completed, and much more. The app is currently in alpha development, and functions as a typical scheduling webapp. The app has a front end of VueJS with a VueX store, a backend server in PHP, and the database is in MySQL.

# Launching The Project
Infinity Scheduler requires xampp for local development. You get xampp here: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html. Once xampp is installed, clone this repository into 
xampp/htdocs/. Then, make sure xampp is running and navigate to xampp/htdocs/Infinity-Scheduler/Infinity-Scheduler/ and run "npm run devbuild". This will create a build of
the vueJS frontend and copy the php server files into xampp/htdocs. The site should be running at localhost at this point. "npm run devbuild" will have to be run after
each update is made in order to see any changes made

# Zhifeng's Contributions
In this project, I mainly worked on implementing features on the home page and caldendar page, as well as all of the databsae scripts and stylying of the features I implemented. I have also supported the team in helping with bug fixes, peer coding sessions, and research during the early stages of the project. Some research I have done are testing different databases with the website. As a member of a team, I have also set up and hosted weekly meetings, documented weekly progress, and proposed features to implement in upcoming weeks.
